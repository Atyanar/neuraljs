# neuraljs

NeuralJS is a Javascript library implementing: 

- Deep **Recurrent Neural Networks** (RNN) 
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks** (LSTM)
- **Gated Recurrent Units** (GRU)

It is based on RecurrentJS (https://github.com/karpathy/recurrentjs) but is rewritten from scratch and supplemented with support for GRU's, a cleaner code structure and an API that should be easier to use.

## Example code

Please check out the demo for now.
